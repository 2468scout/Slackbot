# README #

The Slack Bot is a work in progress. Here is where we will list future and current functions. 

### What is this repository for and about? ###

* FRC Team 2468 (Appreciate) scouting app integration with Slack. 
* Super duper pre alpha alpha pre 0.0.01
* Kate is hosting the bot for now, so all code is tested through her. Technically speaking anyone could run the bot with the code, but need the following extra things:
* * Node.Js
* * in console/terminal/command prompt: npm install slackbots
* * in console/terminal/command prompt: npm install request

### What do we want? ### NOTE TO IAN HEY UMM PUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE THIS IS OUR TO DO LIST
* Slack Bot (duh)
* Connection with scouting server/client? (plz elaborate here)
* The ability to request team stats through Slack
* So you need it to basically send a lot of the data for a team whenever someone sends "#teamnumber" in any message 
* * for example if I was talking to someone and said "Let's look at #2468 stats" it would pop up the stats for team 2468
* Have it on all the relevant channels

### What needs to be tested? (code written, not tested) ###

* 

### What has already been implemented? (Tried and Tested) ###

* The bot is on the server
* bot sends a message on successful startup
* bot responds to prompts
* lets users send info through the ~add info command
* lets users see sent info through ~intel
* let's verified users remove or clear intel array through ~robostats removal [#] and ~submitted
* gives a list of userIDs who tried to use "verified" commands but weren't "verified" (~verifying)
* robostats [team number] now connects through http get request. It's set up and ready to connect with Lauren's server.

### Who do I talk to? ###
